> * **Description**: This project will introduce you to Hyperskill projects. Practice Java coding to build a program that can automate your
    account management routine.

## About
Imagine that you're the owner of a new small corner shop. You are doing well and want to determine how much you earned 
in the first month. Create a simple tool that will calculate your net income. Upon completing this project, you can use
